Industrial robot programming and simulation using KUKA KR 6 R900 and RoboDK

## Project Overview
This project focuses on industrial robot motion planning and task validation using the KUKA KR 6 R900 robot model in RoboDK. The objective was to simulate controlled robot movements and analyze workspace behavior in a virtual industrial environment.

## Objectives
- Develop and validate robot motion sequences
- Implement joint (PTP) and linear (LIN) movements
- Analyze workspace reachability
- Simulate task execution in a controlled environment

## Tools Used
- RoboDK
- KUKA KR 6 R900 industrial robot model
- Industrial robotics fundamentals

## Implementation
- Defined target positions within the robot workspace
- Executed motion sequences using structured movement commands
- Validated trajectory behavior and reach limits in simulation
- Observed motion consistency and repeatability

## Repository Structure
- simulation/ → RoboDK simulation file (.rdk)

## Conclusion
This project provided practical exposure to industrial robot kinematics, motion planning principles, and virtual validation of robotic tasks using a digital simulation environment.
